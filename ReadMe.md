# Computing for Research 2022 Bootcamp Materials
This repo houses data and notebooks for the 2022 DSEER "Computing for Research" bootcamp.

## TO DO BEFORE BOOTCAMP BEGINS:
1) Follow the setup instructions on [this page](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#setup) titled "The Bash Shell", "Git" and "Python". Basically, everything under "Setup" not including "R" or "text editor." 
      - For python, install Anaconda.
      - The videos may be helpful. 
      - These additional tutorials may also be helpful to skim:
            _Unix shell/command line:_ http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/
            _Version control with git:_ http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/
2) If you don't already have a preffered text editor, install the free version of BBEdit [here](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/). If you already use a text editor you are familiar with, you can skip this step.
3) Make a github account [here](http://github.com)
4) If you use Windows, get yourself a console emulator like cmder or conemu. Alternatively, you can do this all on RCC login nodes if you prefer. Another alternative is installing a windows subsystem for linux, which may sound like overkill now but is really beneficial in the long run.

Please ping the slack if you have any issues! We will have some time to spend on the first day troubleshooting, but if you can get a jump on solving the problem that's preferred.

# Daily Github Pull

Each day we will pull the most recent version of the daily jupyter notebook from this central Github location. Don't get ahead of yourself -- we're tired overworked grad students and will likely be uploading the final version the night before or morning of class. So we'll perform this pull every day together.

### First day
1) open terminal or other application for the bash/zsh command line 
2) `cd` into the directory you want your bootcamp materials to live in
3) `git clone https://github.com/NRT-DSEER/computing-for-research-2022.git`
4) `cd computing-for-research-2022.git`
5) `cd notebooks`
6) `jupyter notebook`

### Subsequent days
1) open terminal
2) move into bootcamp directory
3) `git pull`
4) `cd notebooks`
5) `jupyter notebook`
